# VGVM: Efficient GPU Capabilities in Virtual Machines

In this project we address the challenge of integrating GPGPU (General Purpose Computations on GPUs) into virtualized environments. We implement a mechanism that the enables the execution of CUDA applications within Virtual Machines. The framework consists of two components : a user level library, and paravirtualized driver, which enables communication with the host's GPU driver.
